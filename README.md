# Build++

Build++ is a project builder that can simplify building projects in multitude of compilers and environments.

## Installation

Then, you may install (and update) directly from this repository using following command:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/kirillsemyonkin/buildpp
```

Check out [wiki Installation page](https://github.com/kirillsemyonkin/buildpp/wiki/Installation) for the full guide.

## Usage

Check out [wiki](https://github.com/kirillsemyonkin/buildpp/wiki) to learn how to install Build++ and build and run projects using it.

Also check out [MSMPI example project configuration file](https://github.com/kirillsemyonkin/buildpp/blob/master/example.build%2B%2B.lsd), that should show how to setup a local compiled library dependency.
